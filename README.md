## General Information

- Lending Club is a financial services company that offer peer-to-peer lending services. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
- In this case study we analyse the data that contains historical information about loan applicants from lending club and look closely at whether they defaulted or not.
- The aim is to study features in the data set identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default. These finding may then be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions

The driving factors behind loan default include the following variables:

1. Borrower has low salary
2. Loan amount is high
3. Interest rate is high
4. 60 months term instead of 30 months term
5. Lower Grade loans
6. Loan type of Small Business
7. Borrower has been bankrupt before
8. Higher dti

One of more combination of above conditions strongly indicate that the loan will default.
